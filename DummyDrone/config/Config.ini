; CCDDrone config file - template
; This is a template of the config file that CCDDrone takes
; to run a DAMIC CCD. In case you want to start fresh,
; you can copy this file and rename it to CCDConfig.ini

; There are three sections. [ccd]. [clocks] and [bias]
; anything appearing after a semicolon is a comment and is ignored
; Each parameter must be on a new line
